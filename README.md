# testStream
Fluid Element Highlighting

### What is it?

A GUI that lets you test and visualize elements in realtime while keeping a single browser instance open.
It's a spin off of functionality from https://github.com/eagleEggs/topanga, a larger testing GUI.

Note: For now, don't forget to add quotes around your element name.

### Requirements

PySimpleGUI (TKinter alternative)<br>
Selenium

### Thanks

Great code from https://gist.github.com/dariodiaz/3104601 and https://gist.github.com/marciomazza/3086536 lead to enable the highlight functionality efficiently, quickly and easily.
